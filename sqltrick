There is a fantastic little script that comes with modern distributions of MySQL., called mysqlsecureinstallation to run it just for the following:
Note: you will need to know the root password for MySQL.

sudo mysql_secure_installation
It will first ask you if you want to change your root password.
then it will ask 3 great questions that the answer will for the most part be yes to.

Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
